I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Product Designer role that you are offering. With over 15 years of experience in product design field and a passion for creating beautiful experiences as well as intuitive and engaging digital products, I am confident in my ability to make a valuable contribution to your team.

In my last role at British Gas, I led the design team to produce aesthetically pleasing yet functional digital products. I've actively been involved in design operations and design systems commissioning and management and while doing that, I have also mentored junior designers, helping them to grow in their careers and make meaningful contributions to our team.

In addition to my UI/UX design and leadership skills, I have strong communication and collaboration abilities. I am comfortable working with cross-functional teams and have a track record of effectively communicating design concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to join the team and contribute to the creation of innovative and user-centered digital products. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience further.

Sincerely,
Awais
